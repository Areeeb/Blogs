                            I have been working on .NET framework for the past three years and have grown my skill set quite exponentially. I began .NET development when I was in my third year of graduation, I built my first .NET application that didn't actually went out the way I expected (P.S. my expectation were more than my capabilities) but that is what defines me. I never set goals based on my capabilities rather I set it in the best way my mind can imagine it. After that project, my thirst for learning .NET framework grew to an extent that I made it one of my choices to move on with my professional career. From that day, till today I have also learned much more other technologies without skipping the technology that I am passionate about [i.e. .NET framework].

                            My journey with Sitecore started when i joined a Dubai based software company in Karachi named "Ovrlod Pvt. Ltd.". I was hired in this company in the last month of my graduation i.e. May 2018, i started making myself professional in .NET development at this place. The core technology of this software company is Sitecore that is a comapany that provides web content management and multichannel marketing automation software. People here build and maintain multiple products for client companies in Dubai.
